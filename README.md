# Hello!

I'm your average low-level enthusiast. I enjoy learning about all the intricate details about computers and how they actually go about doing what they do. I know the following languages:

* Rust
* C
* C++
* Java
* Python

I enjoy fiddling around with pointers and memory in C and C++, but most of my large projects are in Rust. I only use Java for first robotics competition, and I haven't used Python since I put it down to learn C as my second language. I'm currently working on improving my overall knowledge of design patters and good practices as well as deepening my understanding of how memory works at a *very* low level and using that knowledge to make my programs more memory safe.
