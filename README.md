# Hello!

I primarily consider myself a math person, but I always end up coming back to programming because a want to build stuff. My language of choice is Rust, and I'm interested in computer rendering and a tiny bit of machine learning.

I'll eventually figure out what design patterns work for me, but for now all I make is spaghetti code. Maybe one day I'll finish a project.
