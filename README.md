# Hello!

I'm interested in all things low-level, so I love learning about anything regarding computers and how they go about doing what they do. I know the following languages:

* Rust
* C
* C++
* Java
* Python

I enjoy working on projects with C and C++, but I mainly use Rust for projects that need long-term maintenance. I only use Java for first robotics competition, and I haven't used Python since I put it down to learn C as my second language. I'm currently working on improving my overall knowledge of design patters and good practices as well as deepening my understanding of how memory works at a *very* low level and using that knowledge to make my programs better.
